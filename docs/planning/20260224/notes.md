### Personal Notes for Planning/GANTT Chart - Chris

### CS350 Notes
##### General project overview
- Google Doc sent over to us for what to do, can also look at user requirements
- Spend a week doing PHP
- Cpanel for project management (Version 3)
- Documentation is not that good, we can use scribe
- For Coding Guidelines (just kinda look through what we have)
##### Scott Gantt Chart advice
- Only should take a week for most tasks
##### Ask about putting on public github?
- Will work, but need to make sure no insurance or secret keys are exposed

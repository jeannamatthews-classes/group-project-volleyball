### 3a) Tell me what GANTT chart tracking software you've chose to use (Excel, Google sheets, dotProject, etc.)

Excel, since we all know how to use it, and it has nice templates.

### 3b) Propose a plan for updating the GANTT chart each week. Will you meet to update it collectively? Will you identify one person who will be in charge of actually updating the GANTT chart and exporting a PDF version along with some high level notes about how it has changed (more subtasks added, some subtasks completed, critical path slipping, new estimates)?

We will meet at least once week, as we have already been doing, and discuss the Gantt chart during said meetings. It will be updated, primarily by Chris. However, we will all work together in how it will be updated.

### 3c) Describe your anticipated/target MVP as well as at least one "Plan B" MVP for if the schedule is slipping and a "Plan A+" if things are going really well.

Target MVP:
Integrate the API, refactor any poor/broken/unfinished code, document existing & new code, and lastly finish integrating the front-end template.

Plan B:
everything from the target MVP, except front-end. Front-end is a primary objective; however, ensuring the project has a stable functioning basis is our top priority.

Plan A+:
If we meet all goals of target MVP, Scott is open to student suggestions of features, and probably has some things he would want added as well.

### 3d) At this point, what do you see being on the critical path towards your MVP?

The critical path includes:
The team becoming acquainted with the project and tools used to manage it.
Integrate the API, debugging as we go in order to correctly and effectively integrate the API.
Then, debug the rest of the code, and make it more efficent in order to complete the "Plan B MVP".
Complete the integration of the front-end template.

### 3e) Identify a list of key risks to the success of your project. Discuss a plan for resolving the key risks as early as is possible.

Risk 1, the documentation and refacotoring takes much longer than expected:
We do not know the state of the code, and how much refactoring is needed. We do know that there is almost no documentation, "despite working in IT" - Scott. We have enough spare time I belive,
and have given ourselves ample time to allocate to this issue and still be on schedule. Additionally we can use Scott to help us understand his code and the magic behind it.

Risk 2, API troubles:
Scott did state that the API has no documentation as well, so this could be a problem in integrating.
A plan to remedy this is; as we acquaint ourselves with the project and its tools, either ask Scott for documentation, even if rudimentary, and/or one person creates documentation of the API at the very least for our group to use in making navigation of the code easier.
